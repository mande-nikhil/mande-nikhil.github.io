            I am a lecturer (assistant professor) in the <a href="https://www.liverpool.ac.uk/computer-science/">School

            Until December 2022, I was a postdoctoral researcher in the <a

                    blindfolded in under a minute (including memorization time). I've held several national records in
                    the past in the events of solving 3x3 blindfolded, 4x4 blindfolded, 5x5 blindfolded, multiple 3x3's
